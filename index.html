      <h2>Abstract</h2>
      <p>sm4llVTONs (same methodology 4 all VTON) is a new family of highly efficient and specialized diffusion models for virtual try-on (VTON) applications, and more. This page provides an overview of our current models, methodology, and performance benchmarks. The full details of our training methodology and architecture will be published in our upcoming research paper. </p>

      <h2>Introduction</h2>
      <h3>Our Current Models</h3>
      <p>The sm4llVTONs family consists of several lightweight models, each an expert in a specific VTON domain. This specialization allows them to achieve state-of-the-art results on relatively small, targeted datasets.</p>

      <h3>Key Philosophy & Features</h3>
      <p>Our work is guided by a core philosophy that distinguishes it from general-purpose VTON and image editing models. Instead of a single, large model that handles many tasks, sm4llVTONs are experts fine-tuned for a single purpose. This results in higher fidelity, better detail preservation, and more intuitive control. Our methodology is built around a "train-like-you-infer" principle, ensuring that our models perform reliably on in-the-wild images, not just curated datasets.</p>

    <div class="content-section" id="methodology">
      <h2>Methodology</h2>
      <p>While the complete methodology will be detailed in our paper, we can share a high-level overview of our three-stage process.</p>
      <h3>Data Curation & Preparation</h3>
      <p>The model is trained on a dataset constructed from paired image sources and various augmentation techniques, such as cropping to mask size, automasking, etc. To improve robustness to real-world use cases, we employ a inference-aware masking strategy during the training phase, i.e.: instead of applying the best possible masking pipeline specific to the dataset, we employ the best possible masking pipeline that would be applied during inference instead during training as well. This way, we are able to generate masks that simulate user behaviour in production pipelines, instead of relying on best case scenarios that try to replicate training conditions during inference. This enhances the model's robustness against both variance and artifacts common in user-uploaded content.</p>
      <h3>The Training Process</h3>
      <p>All models in the sm4llVTONs family are trained using a unified methodology derived from foundational instruction-based models. We have introduced significant modifications to the training loop, including an optimized loss calculation. This technique focuses the model’s learning exclusively on the relevant image regions, which dramatically improves sample efficiency and the quality of the final result.</p>
      <h3>Inference & Validation</h3>
      <p>Inference is handled via ComfyUI, in an environment that mirrors the training conditions. Our most critical component is a custom, and tailored to the model’s objective, automasking process that is consistent between training and real-world use. This end-to-end consistency is fundamental to our models' success and addresses a common pitfall in VTON systems, where models fail to generalize because their training data does not reflect real-world input.</p>

      <h2>Conclusion</h2>
      <p>The sm4llVTONs family of models represents a significant step forward in the field of specialized virtual try-on applications. By focusing on lightweight, expert models and a "train-as-you-infer" methodology, we achieve high-fidelity results that are robust to real-world conditions. Future work will involve the release of the full research paper with detailed benchmarks and continued development of the alpha and beta models.</p>
